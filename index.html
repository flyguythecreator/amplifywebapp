			<h2>What Our Platform Provides</h2>
				<p>PanaceaCare Medical (PCM), second largest hospital chain in North America (NYSE: PanCM), announced today a Web App, COVID-Help, for American public to self-check COVID severity, and if an immediate treatment is required, connect directly with nearest hospital to check availability of medical resources and register. Suspected COVID patience, other than those needing 911 emergency, can use the COVID-Help to get connected to any of PCM’s 210 hospitals, and Urgent Care networks, within minutes and get guidance rather than anxiously rushing to the hospitals.</p>

				<p>
					PCM’s medical facilities were overwhelmed with rush of patients — at its peak 3 times the number of its capacity ICU beds — due to mass panic during the first wave. Nearly 60% of the people who rushed to their facilities did not require hospitalization. PCM’s medical staff — doctors and nurses — were overstretched with this rush, and were disrupted in their work for critical COVID patients who are in more need of medical attention. PCM’s current on-premises IT system could not be scaled in time nor able to provide low latency response across all of its 210+ medical facilities to launch the remote helpline for COVID patients. PCM chose AWS as their cloud partner to quickly launch the Web App and go global in minutes.
				</p>

				<p>
					COVID suspected patients, those that do not have 911 emergency, can register on COVID-Help that guides them through a series of self-assessment questions. Based on age, pre-existing conditions and COVID symptoms, the app then quickly connects the patients to nearest available medical resources from the network of PCM’s hospitals. Depending on the severity and medical conditions, a PCM medical practitioner will reach out the patients via phone or web-chat to guide them in person (note: this is not MVP, but to give a picture of an overall solution).
				</p>

				<p>
					“For PCM’s patients, quick response time and transparent view of our available medical resources across 210+ facilities are very important. We also needed to launch this app quickly and scale it quickly. Choosing AWS is a no brainer for us”, says SVP of IT Operations at PCM, “With AWS Serverless Cloud Computing we were able to quickly link our on-premise data, and use scalable native apps that can provide low latency for patients across our hospitals”.
				</p>

				<p>
					COVID-Help uses cloud native applications on AWS to scale, offer low latency experience for patients to quickly self- check COVID severity, and if severe, guide them to nearest hospital for available medical resources. PCM expects 3 Million patents to register within first two weeks of COVID-Help release, and at least 60% those patience can be treated remotely without needing to rush to the hospital.
				</p>

				<p>
					“Our ability to server our patients better without stressing our medical staff in these difficult times is very important”, says CEO of PCM, “Amazon Web Services gives us a platform to expand this Web App as a comprehensive Telemedicine platform for PCM. We intend to use this platform for COVID vaccine distributions and offer wider telehealth in future.”
